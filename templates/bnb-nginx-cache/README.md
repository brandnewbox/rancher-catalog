# BNB Nginx Cache

A Rancher catalog build of BNB's [nginx-cache](https://github.com/brandnewbox/nginx-cache) container.

This is a barebones implementation and much more can be configured via environment variables.

Check out the [BNB repo](https://github.com/brandnewbox/nginx-cache) for a full list of said environment variable options.

As of April 2018, Nate couldn't figure out a good way to purge the contents of the cache. So it may just be easier to delete the stack and start over.
